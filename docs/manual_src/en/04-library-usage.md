# Ruby API

rperf provides a Ruby API for programmatic profiling. This is useful when you want to profile specific sections of code, integrate profiling into test suites, or build custom profiling workflows.

## Basic usage

### Block form (recommended)

The simplest way to use rperf is with the block form of [`Rperf.start`](#index:Rperf.start). It profiles the block and returns the profiling data:

```ruby
require "rperf"

data = Rperf.start(output: "profile.pb.gz", frequency: 1000, mode: :cpu) do
  # code to profile
end
```

When `output:` is specified, the profile is automatically written to the file when the block finishes. The method also returns the raw data hash for further processing.

### Example: Profiling a Fibonacci function

```ruby
require "rperf"

def fib(n)
  return n if n <= 1
  fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
end

data = Rperf.start(frequency: 1000, mode: :cpu) do
  fib(33)
end

Rperf.save("profile.txt", data)
```

Running this produces:

```
Total: 192.7ms (cpu)
Samples: 192, Frequency: 1000Hz

Flat:
     192.7ms 100.0%  Object#fib (example.rb)

Cumulative:
     192.7ms 100.0%  Object#fib (example.rb)
     192.7ms 100.0%  block in <main> (example.rb)
     192.7ms 100.0%  Rperf.start (lib/rperf.rb)
     192.7ms 100.0%  <main> (example.rb)
```

### Manual start/stop

For cases where block form is awkward, you can manually start and stop profiling:

```ruby
require "rperf"

Rperf.start(frequency: 1000, mode: :wall)

# ... code to profile ...

data = Rperf.stop
```

[`Rperf.stop`](#index:Rperf.stop) returns the data hash, or `nil` if the profiler was not running.

## Rperf.start parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `frequency:` | Integer | 1000 | Sampling frequency in Hz |
| `mode:` | Symbol | `:cpu` | `:cpu` or `:wall` |
| `output:` | String | `nil` | File path to write on stop |
| `verbose:` | Boolean | `false` | Print statistics to stderr |
| `format:` | Symbol | `nil` | `:json`, `:pprof`, `:collapsed`, `:text`, or `nil` (auto-detect from output extension) |
| `signal:` | Integer/Boolean | `nil` | Linux only: `nil` = timer signal (default), `false` = nanosleep thread, positive integer = specific RT signal number |
| `aggregate:` | Boolean | `true` | Aggregate identical stacks during profiling to reduce memory. `false` returns raw per-sample data |
| `defer:` | Boolean | `false` | Start with timer paused. Use [`Rperf.profile`](#index:Rperf.profile) blocks to activate sampling for specific sections |

## Rperf.stop return value

`Rperf.stop` returns `nil` if the profiler was not running. Otherwise it returns a Hash:

```ruby
{
  mode: :cpu,                # or :wall
  frequency: 1000,
  trigger_count: 1234,       # number of timer triggers
  sampling_count: 1234,      # number of timer callbacks
  sampling_time_ns: 56789,   # total time spent sampling (overhead)
  detected_thread_count: 4,  # threads seen during profiling
  start_time_ns: 17740...,   # CLOCK_REALTIME epoch nanos
  duration_ns: 10000000,     # profiling duration in nanos

  # aggregate: true (default) — present only in this mode
  unique_frames: 42,         # unique frame count
  unique_stacks: 120,        # unique stack count
  aggregated_samples: [                   # Array of [frames, weight, thread_seq, label_set_id]
    [frames, weight, seq, lsi],           #   frames: [[path, label], ...] deepest-first
    ...                                   #   weight: Integer (nanoseconds)
  ],                                      #   seq: Integer (thread sequence, 1-based)
                                          #   lsi: Integer (label set ID, 0 = no labels)

  # aggregate: false — present only in this mode (C returns raw_samples;
  # Ruby's stop also builds aggregated_samples from them for encoder use)
  raw_samples: [                          # same element format as aggregated_samples
    [frames, weight, seq, lsi],
    ...
  ],

  label_sets: [{}, {request: "abc"}],     # label set table (present when labels used)
}
```

Each sample (in both `aggregated_samples` and `raw_samples`) has:
- **frames**: An array of `[path, label]` pairs, ordered deepest-first (leaf frame at index 0)
- **weight**: Time in nanoseconds attributed to this sample
- **thread_seq**: Thread sequence number (1-based, assigned per profiling session)
- **label_set_id**: Label set ID (0 = no labels). Index into the `label_sets` array

When `aggregate: true` (default), identical stacks are merged and their weights summed. The `aggregated_samples` array contains one entry per unique `(stack, thread_seq, label_set_id)` combination. When `aggregate: false`, the C extension returns `raw_samples` with every individual timer sample; Ruby's `Rperf.stop` also builds `aggregated_samples` from them so encoders always work.

## Rperf.save

[`Rperf.save`](#index:Rperf.save) writes profiling data to a file in any supported format:

```ruby
Rperf.save("profile.pb.gz", data)        # pprof format
Rperf.save("profile.collapsed", data)    # collapsed stacks
Rperf.save("profile.txt", data)          # text report
```

The format is auto-detected from the file extension. You can override it with the `format:` keyword:

```ruby
Rperf.save("output.dat", data, format: :text)
```

## Rperf.snapshot

[`Rperf.snapshot`](#index:Rperf.snapshot) returns the current profiling data without stopping. Only works in aggregate mode (the default). Returns `nil` if not profiling.

```ruby
Rperf.start(frequency: 1000)
# ... work ...
snap = Rperf.snapshot
Rperf.save("snap.pb.gz", snap)
# ... more work (profiling continues) ...
data = Rperf.stop
```

With `clear: true`, the aggregated data is reset after taking the snapshot. This enables interval-based profiling where each snapshot covers only the period since the last clear:

```ruby
Rperf.start(frequency: 1000)
loop do
  sleep 10
  snap = Rperf.snapshot(clear: true)
  Rperf.save("profile-#{Time.now.to_i}.pb.gz", snap)
end
```

## Sample labels

[`Rperf.label`](#index:Rperf.label) attaches key-value labels to the current thread's samples. Labels appear in [pprof](#index:pprof) sample labels, enabling per-context filtering (e.g., per-request profiling). If profiling is not running, `label` is silently ignored — safe to call unconditionally (e.g., from Rack middleware).

### Block form

With a block, labels are automatically restored when the block exits — even if an exception is raised:

```ruby
Rperf.label(request: "abc-123", endpoint: "/api/users") do
  handle_request   # samples inside get these labels
end
# labels are restored to previous state here
```

### Without block

Without a block, labels persist on the current thread until changed:

```ruby
Rperf.label(request: "abc-123")
# all subsequent samples on this thread have request="abc-123"
```

### Merging and deleting

New labels merge with existing ones. Set a value to `nil` to remove a key:

```ruby
Rperf.label(request: "abc")
Rperf.label(phase: "db")       # adds phase, keeps request
Rperf.labels                   #=> {request: "abc", phase: "db"}
Rperf.label(request: nil)      # removes request
Rperf.labels                   #=> {phase: "db"}
```

### Nested blocks

Each block creates a scope. When it exits, the labels are restored to the state before the block — regardless of what happened inside:

```ruby
Rperf.label(request: "abc") do
  Rperf.label(phase: "db") do
    Rperf.labels  #=> {request: "abc", phase: "db"}
  end
  Rperf.labels    #=> {request: "abc"}
end
Rperf.labels      #=> {}
```

### Filtering by label in pprof

Labels are written into pprof sample labels. Use `go tool pprof` to filter:

```bash
# Filter to specific label value
go tool pprof -tagfocus=request=abc-123 profile.pb.gz

# Group by label at stack root ("which requests are slow?")
go tool pprof -tagroot=request profile.pb.gz

# Group by label at stack leaf ("who calls this function?")
go tool pprof -tagleaf=request profile.pb.gz

# Exclude specific label value
go tool pprof -tagignore=request=healthcheck profile.pb.gz
```

### Reading labels

[`Rperf.labels`](#index:Rperf.labels) returns the current thread's labels as a Hash:

```ruby
Rperf.labels  #=> {request: "abc", phase: "db"}
```

Returns an empty Hash if no labels are set.

## Deferred start and Rperf.profile

### Why defer?

Normally, `Rperf.start` immediately begins firing the sampling timer. Every timer tick interrupts the application to capture a stack trace — this is the profiling overhead. For long-running servers, you may not want to pay this cost for all code at all times. You might only care about specific endpoints, jobs, or code paths.

`defer: true` solves this. It sets up the profiler infrastructure (buffers, hooks, worker thread) but **does not start the timer**. The timer only fires inside [`Rperf.profile`](#index:Rperf.profile) blocks. Outside those blocks, overhead is zero — no signals, no interrupts, no stack captures.

```
start(defer: false)     start(defer: true)
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ start            │     │ start            │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │     │                  │  ← timer not firing
│ ▓ sampling ▓▓▓▓ │     │ ┌──profile──┐   │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │     │ │▓▓sampling▓│   │  ← timer active
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │     │ └───────────┘   │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │     │                  │  ← timer not firing
│ stop             │     │ stop             │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

This is especially useful with [framework integrations](#index:Framework Integration): the middleware wraps each request/job in a `profile` block, so only actual request processing is sampled.

### Rperf.profile

[`Rperf.profile`](#index:Rperf.profile) activates the timer for the duration of the block and optionally applies labels. It combines timer control with label assignment in a single call.

```ruby
require "rperf"

Rperf.start(defer: true, mode: :wall)

# Timer activates here, samples get endpoint="/users" label
Rperf.profile(endpoint: "/users") do
  handle_request
end
# Timer paused — zero overhead

Rperf.profile(endpoint: "/health") do
  check_health
end

data = Rperf.stop
Rperf.save("profile.pb.gz", data)
```

### Nesting

`profile` blocks can be nested. The timer stays active until the outermost block exits. Labels merge just like [`Rperf.label`](#index:Rperf.label):

```ruby
Rperf.profile(endpoint: "/users") do
  Rperf.profile(phase: "db") do
    # sampled with {endpoint: "/users", phase: "db"}
    query_db
  end
  # sampled with {endpoint: "/users"}
  render_response
end
# timer paused again
```

### Combining with Rperf.label

`profile` controls the timer; `label` only adds tags. They can be used together:

```ruby
Rperf.start(defer: true, mode: :wall)

Rperf.profile(endpoint: "/users") do
  Rperf.label(phase: "auth") do
    authenticate     # sampled, labeled with endpoint + phase
  end
  Rperf.label(phase: "db") do
    query_db         # sampled, labeled with endpoint + phase
  end
end
```

### Without defer

`profile` also works with a normal (non-deferred) start. In that case, the timer is already running and `profile` only applies labels — equivalent to `Rperf.label` with a block:

```ruby
Rperf.start(mode: :wall)
Rperf.profile(endpoint: "/users") do
  handle_request   # sampled (timer was already running)
end
```

### Error handling

`profile` raises `RuntimeError` if profiling is not started, and `ArgumentError` if no block is given. Labels and timer state are properly restored even if an exception is raised inside the block.

## Practical examples

### Profiling a web request handler

```ruby
require "rperf"

class ApplicationController
  def profile_action
    data = Rperf.start(mode: :wall) do
      # Simulate a typical request
      users = User.where(active: true).limit(100)
      result = users.map { |u| serialize_user(u) }
      render json: result
    end

    Rperf.save("request_profile.txt", data)
  end
end
```

Using wall mode here captures not just CPU time but also database I/O and any GVL contention.

### Comparing CPU and wall profiles

```ruby
require "rperf"

def workload
  # Mix of CPU and I/O
  100.times do
    compute_something
    sleep(0.001)
  end
end

# CPU profile: shows where CPU cycles go
cpu_data = Rperf.start(mode: :cpu) { workload }
Rperf.save("cpu.txt", cpu_data)

# Wall profile: shows where wall time goes
wall_data = Rperf.start(mode: :wall) { workload }
Rperf.save("wall.txt", wall_data)
```

The CPU profile will focus on `compute_something`, while the wall profile will show the `sleep` calls with a `%GVL: blocked` label.

### Processing samples

You can work with the sample data programmatically. By default, samples are aggregated (identical stacks merged):

```ruby
require "rperf"

data = Rperf.start(mode: :cpu) { workload }
# data[:aggregated_samples] contains aggregated entries (one per unique stack)

# Find the hottest function
flat = Hash.new(0)
data[:aggregated_samples].each do |frames, weight, thread_seq|
  leaf_label = frames.first&.last  # frames[0] is the leaf
  flat[leaf_label] += weight
end

top = flat.sort_by { |_, w| -w }.first(5)
top.each do |label, weight_ns|
  puts "#{label}: #{weight_ns / 1_000_000.0}ms"
end
```

To get raw (non-aggregated) per-sample data, pass `aggregate: false`. Each timer tick produces a separate entry:

```ruby
data = Rperf.start(mode: :cpu, aggregate: false) { workload }
# data[:raw_samples] contains one entry per timer sample
data[:raw_samples].each do |frames, weight, thread_seq|
  puts "thread=#{thread_seq} weight=#{weight}ns depth=#{frames.size}"
end
```

### Generating collapsed stacks for FlameGraph

```ruby
require "rperf"

data = Rperf.start(mode: :cpu) { workload }
Rperf.save("profile.collapsed", data)
```

The collapsed format is one line per unique stack, compatible with Brendan Gregg's [FlameGraph](#cite:gregg2016) tools and speedscope:

```
frame1;frame2;...;leaf weight_ns
```

You can generate a flame graph SVG:

```bash
flamegraph.pl profile.collapsed > flamegraph.svg
```

Or open the `.collapsed` file directly in [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/).
